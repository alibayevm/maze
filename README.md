# Maze Generator & Path Finder
Generates a maze using Prim's algorithm and finds the shortest path between 2 points using unweighted version of Dijkstra's algorithm (i.e., BFS algorithm).

## Overview

This repository contains the code that generates a maze using Prim's algorithm and finds the shortest path between 2 points using unweighted version of Dijkstra's algorithm (i.e., BFS algorithm). Both maze generation and path finding are visualized on an OpenCV window and the built maze and found path are saved as JPEG images.

## Using the program

### Setup

To run the code, you need to have the following setup:

*	Python version 3.*
*	OpenCV version 3.*
*	Numpy (should come with OpenCV)

### Running the code

Here is the sample execution process:

1. Run `$ python mazegen.py`, you will see a window where the maze gets generated by using Prim's algorithm.
2. After the maze was generated, click on any 2 cells with your left button of your mouse. Then press any key to resume.
3. You will see how Dijkstra's algorithm searches for the shortest path between those cells.
4. When algorithm finishes, press any key to see the shortest path.
5. Press any key again to finish the execution.

The generated maze has a random number of rows and columns. If you would like to specify those, just add 2 corresponding numbers to the execution command:

`$ python mazegen.py 25 30`

The command above will generate a maze with 25 rows and 30 columns. Use -h flag to see other optional arguments:

`$ python mazegen.py -h`

If you want to skip the building animation, add `-b` or `--skip_building_animation` flag.
If you want to skip the searching animation, add `-s` or `--skip_searching_animation` flag.
